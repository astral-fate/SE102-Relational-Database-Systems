Key SQL concepts and functions covered in Chapter 6 (Basic SQL):

1. Table Creation and Schema Definition:
    - CREATE TABLE
    - CREATE SCHEMA
    - CREATE DOMAIN
    - Data types (VARCHAR, CHAR, INT, DATE, etc.)
    - Primary key declaration
    - Foreign key declaration
    - NOT NULL constraints

2. Column Constraints:
    - DEFAULT values
    - CHECK constraints
    - UNIQUE constraints
    - Referenced table constraints
    - Column references

3. Basic Query Components:
    - SELECT clause (attribute selection)
    - FROM clause (table specification)
    - WHERE clause (condition specification)
    - ORDER BY clause (sorting results)
    - DISTINCT keyword (removing duplicates)
    - Asterisk (*) for selecting all columns

4. Basic Operations:
    - INSERT INTO
    - DELETE FROM 
    - UPDATE
    - Table aliasing with AS
    - Pattern matching with LIKE
    - NULL comparisons (IS NULL, IS NOT NULL)

5. String Operations:
    - String concatenation (||)
    - Pattern matching with wildcards (%, _)
    - String comparisons
    - ESCAPE character usage

6. Arithmetic Operations:
    - Basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
    - Numeric comparisons
    - BETWEEN operator

7. Comparison Operators:
    - Standard comparisons (<, >, =, <=, >=, <>)
    - Multiple value comparisons (IN, NOT IN)
    - String comparisons

8. Set Operations:
    - UNION
    - INTERSECT
    - EXCEPT

9. Table Modification:
    - Adding/removing rows
    - Modifying existing data
    - Handling constraints during modifications
    - Using triggered actions (CASCADE, SET NULL)
